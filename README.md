# Unsupervised Exploration and Offline Reinforcement Learning

## Abstract
- Imagine teaching a robot to navigate a maze without providing step-by-step instructions or rewards for each correct move. This research project
explores innovative ways to enable machines to learn and make decisions independently. By allowing the machine to explore its environment
freely, it can gather valuable information and experiences without constant human guidance. Additionally, we will investigate methods that
allow the machine to learn from previously collected data, reducing the need for continuous real-time interaction during the learning process. The goal is to develop intelligent systems that can explore effectively in complex environments, even when direct feedback is limited
